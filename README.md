A passionate student studying Econonics and Mathmatics. I am interested in how machine learning and data science can improve economic models and research.

 **Education**: Bachelor of Arts in Mathmatics & Economics @ Columbia
 **Experience**: Individual projects, NYU AI Camp, Cornell BreakThrough Tech  
 **Skills**: Interemidate in Python & C++ 

 
 **Projects**:  
- [Tweet Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/RoseMyer/tsla-sentiment-analysis)
  This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using an SVM classifier to analyze customer feedback.
  
- [Realitvity AI Studio](https://github.com/kavya-adusu/relativity1A)
  This project was a semester-long study focused on potential bias in frontier models, specifically examining whether women with children were discriminated against compared to other 
  applicants. Using Amazonâ€™s generalized fairness metric, available [here](https://github.com/amazon-science/generalized-fairness-metrics/tree/main/src/models), and the findings from [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-022-09790-7) study, we developed a template centered on the prescreening of job applications.
  My contributions included conducting research, coordinating the project, creating the templates, writing code to integrate the templates with the Gemini API, and analyzing the results.
  Our findings revealed a small statistical bias against women with children during the hiring process. This subgroup consistently scored between 2â€“3, while the professional group scored between 3â€“4.
  
  
- [Census Class Predictor Model](https://github.com/RoseMyer/Census_Class_Prediction)
  This project utilized 1994 census data to predict socioeconomic groups using a classification model. The dataset included features such as age, marital status, gender, and education level,
  and explored how machine learning (ML) models compare to Random Forest in their predictive accuracy. The purpose of the project was to assist potential policymaking by predicting future labor
  market trends, though its applications are widespread. After initially receiving a high loss function (0.79) with a neural network model, I switched to using Random Forest. However, the results
  exhibited significant bias due to the lack of variation in the dataset. I believe that with more diverse and comprehensive data for training, the accuracy of the predictions could be significantly
  improved.
